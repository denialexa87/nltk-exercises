import nltk

# Übung 3
# Tokenize and tag the following sentence:
# They wind back the clock, while we chase after the wind.
# What different pronunciations and parts of speech are involved?
tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize("They wind back the clock, while we chase after the wind.")
nltk.pos_tag(tokens)

# Übung 34
# There are 264 distinct words in the Brown Corpus having exactly three possible tags.
	# 1. Print a table with the integers 1..10 in one column,
	# and the number of distinct words in the corpus having
	# 1..10 distinct tags in the other column.
from nltk.corpus import brown

	# 2. For the word with the greatest number of distinct tags,
	# print out sentences from the corpus containing the word,
	# one for each possible tag. (15 Punkte)

# Übung 5
	# 1. Write code to produce two trees, one for each reading
	# of the phrase "old men and women"

	# 2. Encode any of the trees presented in this chapter
	# as a labeled bracketing and use nltk.Tree() to check
	# that it is well-formed. Now use draw() to display the tree.

	# 3. As in (a) above, draw a tree for
	# "The woman saw a man last Thursday". (7 Punkte)

# Übung 25
# Download several electronic books from Project Gutenberg.
	# Write a program to scan these texts for any extremely long sentences.

	# What is the longest sentence you can find?

	# What syntactic construction(s) are responsible
	# for such long sentences? (10 Punkte)
